  <h4>Lecture overview</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Lecture 1, Jan 22</dt>
      <dd>Introduction.  The many points of view on <em>M<sub>g</sub></em>: holomorphic (Riemann surfaces), algebraic geometric (complex algebraic curves), differential geometric (constant curvature), group theoretic (mapping class groups), homotopy theoretic (classifying space for diffeomorphism groups).  The homotopy theoretic incarnation generalizes well to other dimensions.  Statements of some theorems (Harer, Tillmann, Madsen-Weiss; myself and Randal-Williams).</dd>

      <dt>Lecture 2, Jan 29</dt>
      <dd>Cobordism categories as (non-unital) topological categories.  To a topological category <em>C</em> we associate an ordinary category <em>hC</em> called the homotopy category, and a topological space <em>BC</em> called the classifying space.</dd>

      <dt>Lecture 3, Feb 5</dt>
      <dd>More on topological categories.  Group completion.  Spectra and Thom spectra.</dd>
