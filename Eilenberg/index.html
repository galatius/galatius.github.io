  <h4>Lecture overview</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Lecture 1, Jan 22</dt>
      <dd>Introduction.  The many points of view on <em>M<sub>g</sub></em>: holomorphic (Riemann surfaces), algebraic geometric (complex algebraic curves), differential geometric (constant curvature), group theoretic (mapping class groups), homotopy theoretic (classifying space for diffeomorphism groups).  The homotopy theoretic incarnation generalizes well to other dimensions.  Statements of some theorems (Harer, Tillmann, Madsen-Weiss; myself and Randal-Williams).</dd>

      <dt>Lecture 2, Jan 29</dt>
      <dd>Cobordism categories as (non-unital) topological categories.  To a topological category <em>C</em> we associate an ordinary category <em>hC</em> called the homotopy category, and a topological space <em>BC</em> called the classifying space.</dd>

      <dt>Lecture 3, Feb 5</dt>
      <dd>More on topological categories.  The group completion map <em>Hom<sub>C</sub>(x,y) &rarr; &Omega;<sub>x,y</sub>BC</em>.  The group completion theorem in the special case of topological monoids (and a promise that the proof by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01403148">McDuff-Segal</a> sometimes can be adapted to the multi-object case).  Spectra, homotopy groups of spectra, weak equivalences between spectra, and the functor <em>&Omega;<sup>&infin;</sup></em> to pointed spaces. Thom spectra and the statement of the main result of <a href="">this paper</a> with Madsen, Tillmann, and Weiss.  Tangential structures on <em>d</em>-dimensional vector bundles and <em>d</em>-dimensional manifolds.</dd>

            <dt>Lecture 4, Feb 12</dt>
      <dd>
	Rational homology of infinite loop spaces.  Homological stability.
