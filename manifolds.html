  <h4>Lecture overview</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Sep 6</dt>
      <dd>Introduction.  Compact smooth manifolds with boundary and corners (Wall sections 1.1, 1.5).  Spherical modification and handle attachments (Wall sections 5.1, 7.1).</dd>
      <dt>Sep 11</dt>
      <dd>Cobordism, gluing (Wall 2.7), collars (existence is Theorem 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 in Wall, uniqueness is 2.5.7/2.5.8).  Corners and straightening (Wall section 2.6).</dd>
      <dt>Sep 13</dt>
      <dd>Some definitions: closed submanifolds (Wall page 19), closed submanifold with boundary (Wall page 31), embedding (Wall page 20-21).  Smooth structure on handle attachments (Wall page 130, referring back to the discussion of corner bending in section 2.6 and glueing in section 2.7).  Spherical modification as a special case: it is <em>&part;<sub>+</sub>(([0,1] x M) &cup;<sub>e</sub> h<sup>r</sup>)</em> for embeddings <em>e: S<sup>r-1</sup> x D<sup>d+1-r</sup> &rarr; {1} x M</em>.</dd>
      
      <dt>Sep 18</dt>
      <dd>Handle attachments vs cell attachments: the manifold <em>W &cup;<sub>e</sub> h<sup>r</sup></em> deformation retracts to <em>W &cup; (D<sup>r</sup> x {0})</em>, a cell attachment in the sense of CW complexes.  The image of <em>D<sup>r</sup> x {0}</em> in <em>W &cup; h<sup>r</sup></em> is called the core of the handle.  <br> We then discussed a possible strategy for inductively building a <em>d</em>-manifold <em>W</em> homotopy equivalent to a given CW complex <em>X</em>.  If we have already found a <em>d</em>-manifold <em>W<sub>k</sub></em> homotopy equivalent to the <em>k</em>-skeleton <em>X<sup>(k)</sup></em>, we must improve the cellular attaching maps <em>S<sup>r-1</sup> &rarr; X<sup>(k)</sup> &simeq; W<sub>k</sub></em> by (1) finding a homotopy to a map <em>e: S<sup>r-1</sup> &rarr; &part; W<sub>k</sub></em> into the boundary, (2) finding a further homotopy from that map to a smooth embedding, and (3) extending that embedding to an embedding of <em>S<sup>r-1</sup> x D<sup>d-r</sup></em>.  <br> The rest of the lecture discussed some examples of handle presentations of manifolds that we also had other descriptions of (for instance the disk bundle of the tangent bundle of a sphere).</dd>

      <dt>Sep 20</dt>
      <dd>The construction of <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/kervaire.pdf">Kervaire spheres</a>, a certain smooth closed manifold of dimension <em>4k+1</em> for each <em>k &geq; 1</em>.  Summary of what is know about them (with a few exceptions, they are not diffeomorphic to <em>S<sup>4k+1</sup></em>, although we do not yet have the tools to show that).  You can find a summary <a href="http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Exotic_spheres#4.7">here</a>, with references.
	
	<br>Handlebodies and the homology of their boundaries via Poincar&eacute; duality.  For an oriented <em>d</em>-dimensional manifold <em>W</em>, Poincar&eacute; duality gives two pairings, the intersection pairing <em>(H<sub>j</sub>(W)/TH<sub>j</sub>(W)) x (H<sub>d-j</sub>(W)/TH<sub>d-j</sub>(W)) &rarr; Z</em>, where <em>TH<sub>j</sub>(W) &sub; H<sub>j</sub>(W)</em> denotes torsion subgroup, and the torsion <a href="http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Linking_form">linking form</a> <em>TH<sub>j</sub>(W) x TH<sub>d-j-1</sub>(W) &rarr; Q/Z</em>.  I then explained that when <em>W</em> is connected and oriented with non-empty boundary, <em>&part;W</em> is a homology sphere if and only if both of these pairings are unimodular for <em>1 &leq; j &leq; d-1</em>.
	<br>We also discussed conditions for <em>&part;W</em> to be simply connected: when <em>W</em> is a handlebody it suffices that there are no 1-handles and no <em>(d-2)</em>-handles.  Finally, we discussed why a simply connected <em>(d-1)</em>-manifold whose homology is isomorphic to <em>H<sub>*</sub>(S<sup>d-1</sup>)</em> as a graded abelian group, is in fact homotopy equivalent to <em>S<sup>d-1</sup></em>.  I.e., a simply connected homology sphere is a homotopy sphere.  The proof used the Hurewicz theorem.

      <dt>Sep 25</dt>
      <dd>Interpretation of intersection pairing and linking form in terms of cup product.  Intersection forms on a handlebody <em>W = D<sup>2n</sup> &cup; h<sup>n</sup> &cup; ... &cup; h<sup>n</sup></em> with <em>k</em> many <em>n</em>-handles can be represented by a matrix <em>A &in; M<sub>k</sub>(<b>Z</b>)</em>, which satisfies <em>A<sup>t</sup> = (-1)<sup>n</sup> A</em>, as a consequence of graded-commutativity of the cup product.
	
	<br>Review/reminder about cup products in relative cohomology and other versions of Poincare duality (see page 209 and Theorem 3.43 in <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Hatcher</a>, for example).  Support of a homology class (being supported in a subspace <em>K &sub; W</em> means being in the image of the homomorphism <em>H<sub>*</sub>(K) &rarr; H<sub>*</sub>(W)</em>) and of a cohomology class (being supported in a subspace <em>K &sub; W</em> means being in the image of the homomorphism <em>H<sup>*</sup>(W, W&setminus;K) &rarr; H<sup>*</sup>(W, &part;W)</em>).  For reasonably nice subspaces <em>K &sub; W&setminus;&part;W</em>, these notions of support are related via an isomorphism <em>H<sup>i</sup>(W, W&setminus;K) &rarr; H<sub>d-i</sub>(K)</em>, which in turn may be established from Poincare duality on some thickening of <em>K</em> to a compact codimension 0 submanifold of <em>W</em>.

	<br>Some consequences, in particular that the intersection product of two homology classes is zero if they are supported on disjoint sets.
      </dd>

      <dt>Sep 27</dt>
      <dd>External product <em>H<sup>n</sup>(X,X&setminus;K) x H<sup>m</sup>(Y,Y&setminus;L) &rarr; H<sup>n+m</sup>(XxY,XxY&setminus;KxL)</em> defined by pulling back along the projections and then taking cup (see page 214 in Hatcher for the case <em>K=L=&emptyset;</em>), used to define preferred generators <em>&sigma;<sub>d</sub> &in; H<sup>d</sup>(<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>,<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>&setminus;{0})</em> as <em>d</em>-fold external product of some chosen <em>&sigma;<sub>1</sub></em>.  These generators will then satisfy the convenient compatibility that the external product <em>&sigma;<sub>n</sub> x &sigma;<sub>m</sub></em> is equal to <em>&sigma;<sub>n+m</sub></em>.

	<br>We take as official definition that an "orientation" of a compact <em>d</em>-manifold <em>M</em> means the specification of a homology class <em>[M]&in;H<sub>d</sub>(M,&part;M)</em> whose image in <em>H<sub>d</sub>(M,M&setminus;{x})</em> is a generator for each <em>x&in;M&setminus;&part;M</em>.  Given that, we can then say that a chart <em>&phi;:<b>R</b><sup>d</sup> &rarr; M</em> is "orientation preserving" if <em>(&phi;)<sub>*</sub>: H<sub>d</sub>(<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>,<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>&setminus;{0}) &rarr; H<sub>d</sub>(M,M&setminus;{&phi;(0)})</em> sends <em>&sigma;<sub>d</sub></em> to the image of <em>[M]</em>.  If a chart is <em>not</em> orientation preserving we say it is orientation-reversing.  For any orientation-reversing chart, we may obtain an orientation-preserving one with the same image by changing sign of one of the coordinates.

	<br>Then we explained how to evaluate the intersection pairing of a degree-<em>n</em> homology class with a degree-<em>m</em> homology class in an <em>(n+m)</em>-manifold as a sum of local contributions, in the case where the classes are supported on closed subsets <em>K</em> and <em>L</em> with <em>K&cap;L = {x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>r</sub>}</em> finite, and such that around each <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> there exists an orientation-preserving chart <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub></em> such that <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub><sup>-1</sup>(K) = <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>x{0}</em> and <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub><sup>-1</sup>(L) ={0}x<b>R</b><sup>m</sup></em> where <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> are the homological degrees of the homology classes.  Pulling back the corresponding cohomology classes along <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub></em> gives a class in <em>H<sup>m</sup>(<b>R</b><sup>m</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>m</sup>&setminus;{0})</em> and a class in <em>H<sup>n</sup>(<b>R</b><sup>n</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>&setminus;{0})</em> which can be written as <em>k<sub>i</sub>&sigma;<sub>m</sub></em> and <em>l<sub>i</sub>&sigma;<sub>n</sub></em> respectively, for some uniquely determined <em>k<sub>i</sub>, l<sub>i</sub> &in; <b>Z</b></em> for each <em>i&in;{1,...,r}</em>.  One must understand the homology classes well enough to work out these two integers (typically <em>&pm;1</em>) at each intersection point.  The outcome of our discussion was that then the intersection pairing of the classes is the dot product <em>&Sigma;<sub>i</sub> k<sub>i</sub>l<sub>i</sub></em>.
	
	<br>We also discussed self-intersection of <em>n</em>-dimensional homology classes <em>&alpha;</em> in a <em>2n</em>-dimensional manifold.  If such a class is supported on a compact subset <em>K</em> which can be pushed off of itself (meaning that the inclusion is homotopic to a map whose image is disjoint from <em>K</em>) then the intersection product of <em>&alpha;</em> with itself is automatically zero.  If not, the second-best think is to find a homotopy from the inclusion of <em>K</em> to a map with some image <em>L</em> intersecting <em>K</em> in a finite set such that there exist charts around each intersection point satisfying the condition we discussed when intersecting two distinct classes.  A good example to keep in mind for self-intersection is the disk bundle of an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector bundle over <em>S<sup>n</sup></em> with inner product, if the vector bundle splits off a trivial summand then the intersection matrix is <em>[0]&in;M<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>)</em>, but for the tangent bundle of <em>S<sup>n</sup></em> it is <em>[2]</em> when <em>n&geq;0</em> is even.

	<br>Finally, I stated the theorem that handlebodies of the form <em>W = D<sup>2n</sup> &cup; h<sup>n</sup> &cup;<sub>e_1</sub> ... &cup;<sub>e_r</sub> h<sup>n</sup></em> can have intersection matrix be any matrix of the form <em>B = A + (-1)<sup>n</sup>A<sup>t</sup></em> for some <em>A&in;M<sub>r</sub>(<b>Z</b>)</em> and explained the strategy of the construction/proof: first explain how to realize <em>A = 0</em>, then explain how to modify the embeddings <em>e_i</em> and <em>e_j</em> for <em>i &le; j</em> in a way that the <em>(i,j)</em> entry of <em>A</em> changes by <em>&pm; 1</em> and all other entries remain the same, and then explain how to modify <em>e_i</em> in a way the the <em>(i,i)</em>-entry changes by <em>&pm;1</em>.
	
	<br>At the end of the lecture I briefly indicated how to achieve the first of these steps, realizing the zero matrix as intersection matrix of a <em>2n</em>-dimensional handlbody.

      <dd>Isotopies of embeddings and diffeomorphisms (Wall calls these &quot;diffeotopies&quot; and discussed them in section 2.4).  Statement of the isotopy extension theorem (Wall Theorem 2.4.2).  Extending isotopies of the boundary of a manifold (Wall Proposition 2.4.5).  Changing a handle attachment map by an isotopy leads to diffeomorphic manifolds after attaching the handle.  Constructing handlebodies <em>W = D<sup>2n</sup>&cup;h<sup>n</sup>...h<sup>n></em> with intersection matrix <em>B = A + (-1)<sup>n<A></em> as stated last week: I sketched how to change the <em>(i,j)</em>th entry of <em>A</em> by <em>&pm;1</em> for <em>i &le; j</em> using an isotopy of the attaching map for the <em>j</em>th handle through an isotopy intersecting the image of the attaching map for the <em>i</em>th handle in a specific way.  (This is sketched in the proof of Theorem 5.8 of Wall's other book <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/tom-readings/Wall,%20Surgery%20on%20Compact%20Manifolds.pdf">Surgery on compact manifolds</a>, although unfortunately he does not write this very carefully.)
      </dd>

      <dt>Oct 4</dt>
      <dd>Application of the construction we have discussed, of handlebodies with specified intersection matrix: the <em>E8</em> matrix and the construction of the Milnor sphere as the boundary of the handlebody <em>W = D<sup>2n</sup>&cup;h<sup>n</sup>...h<sup>n</sup></em> with 8 handles, for <em>n</em> even.

	<br>An extra feature of the general construction: not only can we achieve any intersection matrix of the form <em>B = A + (-1)<sup>n<A></em>, we can also achieve that the inclusion <em>D<sup>2n</sup> &sub; 2D<sup>2n</sup></em>extends to an immersion of <em>W</em> into the larger disk.  (Although it is not yet quite clear why, it will be useful to record that we can realize all intersection matrices in as restricted a way as possible; immersing in a larger disk is one useful condition, which in particular forces <em>W</em> to be parallelizable.  Inside the group <em>&Theta;<sub>n</sub></em> of exotic spheres, there is a subgroup usually denoted <em>bP<sub>n+1</sub></em> where bP stands for &quot;bounds parallelizable&quot;, what we have so far is a construction of elements in that subgroup).
      </dd>

      <dt>Oct 9</dt>
      <dd>The algebra of even lattices.  (A lattice is a pair <em>L = (L,b)</em> consisting of a free abelian group <em>L</em>together with a symmetric bilinear <em>b: L x L &rarr; <b>Z</b></em> whose adjoint <em>L &rarr; </em>Hom<em>(L,<b>Z</b>)</em> is injective.  It is even if <em>b(x,x) &in; 2<b>Z</b></em> for all <em>x</em>.)  The main invariants rank and signature and the values they can take, in particular van der Blij's theorem (the signature of an even unimodular lattice is divisible by 8).  Generalizations (Milgram's formula for the signature modulo 8, see Appendix 4 of <em>Symmetric Bilinear Forms</em> by Milnor and Husemoller).  Direct sums of <em>E8</em>, <em>-E8</em>, and <em>H</em> realize all values of rank and signature, within the constraints that they must satisfy.  Classification results (in particular, two indefinite even unimodular lattices are isomorphic if and only if they have equal rank and signatures).
	  
	<br>Very quick introduction to immersion theory: see in particular Theorem 6.2.1 in Wall's book, which implies that for a manifold <em>M</em> of dimension <em>d &ge; n</em>, the space of immersions <em>S<sup>n</sup>xD<sup>d-n</sup> &rarr; M</em> is homotopy equivalent to the space of continuous maps <em>S<sup>n</sup> &rarr; Fr(M)</em> into the frame bundle.  If <em>M</em> is given an immersion into <em><b>R</b><sup>d</sup></em> then we get a section of the frame bundle, and deduce that any continuous map <em>S<sup>n</sup> &rarr; M</em> is homotopic to one that extends to an immersion <em>S<sup>n</sup>xD<sup>d-n</sup> &rarr; M</em>.  Then I sketched a picture proof (using self-transversality as in Theorem 4.6.6 of Wall) of why, in the case <em>d=2n</em> and <em>x&in;H<sub>n</sub>(M)</em> is a class arising from an immersion <em>S<sup>n</sup>xD<sup>n</sup> &rarr; M</em>, the intersection pairing <em>x&middot;x</em> is an even number (this is relevant only for even <em>n</em> otherwise <em>x&middot;x</em> is zero by the anti-symmetry).
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Oct 11</dt>
      <dd>Incomplete summary of the algebra relevant for <em>2n</em>-dimensional handlebodies immersed in <em>D<sup>2n</sup></em> for <em>odd n</em>: quadratic refinement of the mod 2 reduction of the intersection pairing on <em>L = H<sub>n</sub>(W)</em>.  The quadratic refinement is extra data, but can be thought of as an analogue of the evenness property for even <em>n</em>.
	
	<br>Then we discussed a more general setting, namely: start with a smooth compact <em>(2n-1)</em>-dimensional manifold <em>A</em> and consider a cobordism from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> immersed in <em>[0,2]xB</em>.  Restricting the immersion to the outgoing boundary gives a map <em>B &rarr; A</em> which is a diffeomorphism on boundaries, and we showed that it it is a homology isomorphism if and only if certain pairings are unimodular.  These pairings are defined on the &quot;surgery kernel&quot; which we also defined.  All of this is sketched in these preliminary <a href="manifolds/coursenotes.pdf">notes (updated Oct 11, comments welcome!)</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Oct 16</dt>
      <dd>Homology and cohomology with local coefficients, and how to use it to detect homotopy equivalences between CW complexes.  See preliminary <a href="manifolds/coursenotes.pdf">notes (updated Oct 11, comments welcome!)</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Oct 18</dt>
      <dd>The intersection pairing in homology with local coefficients.  See preliminary <a href="manifolds/coursenotes-oct18.pdf">notes (updated Oct 18, comments welcome!)</a>.  We mainly discussed the case of immersed cobordisms obtained by attaching finitely many <em>n</em>-handles to <em>[0,1]xA</em> for some <em>(2n-1)</em>-manifold <em>A</em>, and was interested in whether the outgoing boundary gives an element of the structure set of <em>A</em> -- that is, whether the immersion restricts to a homotopy equivalence <em>B &rarr; A</em> or not.

	<br>Generalizing the earlier discussion for exotic spheres (viz., how the Milnor sphere arise as the boundary of a handlebody with eight 4-handles attached to an 8-ball according to the <em>E8</em> matrix), the conclusion was that for <em>n&geq;3</em> the conclusion was that <em>B &rarr; A</em> is a homotopy equivalence if and only if the intersection pairing on the surgery kernel is unimodular.  Here it was important to take the &quot;universal&quot; local coefficients, taking values in modules over the group ring of the fundamental group, so that we can use the generalized Hurewicz theorem to detect homotopy equivalences.

      <dd>Geometric interpretation of the intersection pairing with local coefficients.  Classes represented by tethered spheres.

      <dt>Oct 30</dt>
      <dd><em>L</em>-theory of rings with involution, the surgery exact sequence.  We started by a brief review of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witt_group">Witt ring</a> of a field of characteristic different from 2.  This definition is very similar to <em>L</em>-theory, but with fewer complicating details.  The general definition of <em>L</em>-theory is due to Wall and can be found in his book <em>Surgery on Compact Manifolds</em>, although it uses the language of &quot;<em>n</em>-ads&quot; which we have not used in class.  The presentation in class more closely followed the book <a href="https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/lueck/data/sb.pdf">Surgery theory: Foundations</a> by L&uuml;ck and Macko, see especially section 8.5.1 and 8.4.3.  The definition of <em>ring with involution</em> and <em>dual module</em> can be found on page 50.
