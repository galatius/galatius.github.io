  <h2>Topics in high dimensional topology</h2>

  <p> by <a href="https://sorengalatius.com">Soren Galatius</a>, Columbia University, Fall 2023, 11:40AM-12:55PM in room 507.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Texts</b>. We will refer to the 2016 book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316597835">Differential Topology</a> by C.T.C. Wall, an electronic copy of which may be found on the <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~hekmati/LearningSeminar2021.html">internet</a>.  The course will start approximately in chapter 5 of Wall's book, although parts of chapters 1-4 will be reviewed as we go along from an end-user point of view.


    <br>Additional sources may be added as we go along.

  <h4>Lecture overview</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Sep 6</dt>
      <dd>Introduction.  Compact smooth manifolds with boundary and corners (Wall sections 1.1, 1.5).  Spherical modification and handle attachments (Wall sections 5.1, 7.1).</dd>
      <dt>Sep 11</dt>
      <dd>Cobordism, gluing (Wall 2.7), collars (existence is Theorem 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 in Wall, uniqueness is 2.5.7/2.5.8).  Corners and straightening (Wall section 2.6).</dd>
      <dt>Sep 13</dt>
      <dd>Some definitions: closed submanifolds (Wall page 19), closed submanifold with boundary (Wall page 31), embedding (Wall page 20-21).  Smooth structure on handle attachments (Wall page 130, referring back to the discussion of corner bending in section 2.6 and glueing in section 2.7).  Spherical modification as a special case: it is <em>&part;<sub>+</sub>(([0,1] x M) &cup;<sub>e</sub> h<sup>r</sup>)</em> for embeddings <em>e: S<sup>r-1</sup> x D<sup>d+1-r</sup> &rarr; {1} x M</em>.</dd>
      
      <dt>Sep 18</dt>
      <dd>Handle attachments vs cell attachments: the manifold <em>W &cup;<sub>e</sub> h<sup>r</sup></em> deformation retracts to <em>W &cup; (D<sup>r</sup> x {0})</em>, a cell attachment in the sense of CW complexes.  The image of <em>D<sup>r</sup> x {0}</em> in <em>W &cup; h<sup>r</sup></em> is called the core of the handle.  <br>We then discussed a possible strategy for inductively building a <em>d</em>-manifold <em>W</em> homotopy equivalent to a given CW complex <em>X</em>.  If we have already found a <em>d</em>-manifold <em>W<sub>k</sub></em> homotopy equivalent to the <em>k</em>-skeleton <em>X<sup>(k)</sup></em>, we must improve the cellular attaching maps <em>S<sup>r-1</sup> &rarr; X<sup>(k)</sup> &simeq; W<sub>k</sub></em> by (1) finding a homotopy to a map <em>e: S<sup>r-1</sup> &rarr; &part; W<sub>k</sub></em> into the boundary, (2) finding a further homotopy from that map to a smooth embedding, and (3) extending that embedding to an embedding of <em>S<sup>r-1</em> x D<sup>d-r</sup></em>.  <br>The rest of the lecture discussed some examples of handle presentations of manifolds that we also had other descriptions of (for instance the disk bundle of the tangent bundle of a sphere).</dd>
