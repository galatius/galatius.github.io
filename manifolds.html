  <h4>Lecture overview</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Sep 6</dt>
      <dd>Introduction.  Compact smooth manifolds with boundary and corners (Wall sections 1.1, 1.5).  Spherical modification and handle attachments (Wall sections 5.1, 7.1).</dd>
      <dt>Sep 11</dt>
      <dd>Cobordism, gluing (Wall 2.7), collars (existence is Theorem 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 in Wall, uniqueness is 2.5.7/2.5.8).  Corners and straightening (Wall section 2.6).</dd>
      <dt>Sep 13</dt>
      <dd>Some definitions: closed submanifolds (Wall page 19), closed submanifold with boundary (Wall page 31), embedding (Wall page 20-21).  Smooth structure on handle attachments (Wall page 130, referring back to the discussion of corner bending in section 2.6 and glueing in section 2.7).  Spherical modification as a special case: it is <em>&part;<sub>+</sub>(([0,1] x M) &cup;<sub>e</sub> h<sup>r</sup>)</em> for embeddings <em>e: S<sup>r-1</sup> x D<sup>d+1-r</sup> &rarr; {1} x M</em>.</dd>
      
      <dt>Sep 18</dt>
      <dd>Handle attachments vs cell attachments: the manifold <em>W &cup;<sub>e</sub> h<sup>r</sup></em> deformation retracts to <em>W &cup; (D<sup>r</sup> x {0})</em>, a cell attachment in the sense of CW complexes.  The image of <em>D<sup>r</sup> x {0}</em> in <em>W &cup; h<sup>r</sup></em> is called the core of the handle.  <br> We then discussed a possible strategy for inductively building a <em>d</em>-manifold <em>W</em> homotopy equivalent to a given CW complex <em>X</em>.  If we have already found a <em>d</em>-manifold <em>W<sub>k</sub></em> homotopy equivalent to the <em>k</em>-skeleton <em>X<sup>(k)</sup></em>, we must improve the cellular attaching maps <em>S<sup>r-1</sup> &rarr; X<sup>(k)</sup> &simeq; W<sub>k</sub></em> by (1) finding a homotopy to a map <em>e: S<sup>r-1</sup> &rarr; &part; W<sub>k</sub></em> into the boundary, (2) finding a further homotopy from that map to a smooth embedding, and (3) extending that embedding to an embedding of <em>S<sup>r-1</sup> x D<sup>d-r</sup></em>.  <br> The rest of the lecture discussed some examples of handle presentations of manifolds that we also had other descriptions of (for instance the disk bundle of the tangent bundle of a sphere).</dd>

      <dt>Sep 20</dt>
      <dd>The construction of <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/kervaire.pdf">Kervaire spheres</a>, a certain smooth closed manifold of dimension <em>4k+1</em> for each <em>k &geq; 1</em>.  Summary of what is know about them (with a few exceptions, they are not diffeomorphic to <em>S<sup>4k+1</sup></em>, although we do not yet have the tools to show that).  You can find a summary <a href="http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Exotic_spheres#4.7">here</a>, with references.
	
	<br>Handlebodies and the homology of their boundaries via Poincar&eacute; duality.  For an oriented <em>d</em>-dimensional manifold <em>W</em>, Poincar&eacute; duality gives two pairings, the intersection pairing <em>(H<sub>j</sub>(W)/TH<sub>j</sub>(W)) x (H<sub>d-j</sub>(W)/TH<sub>d-j</sub>(W)) &rarr; Z</em>, where <em>TH<sub>j</sub>(W) &sub; H<sub>j</sub>(W)</em> denotes torsion subgroup, and the torsion <a href="http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Linking_form">linking form</a> <em>TH<sub>j</sub>(W) x TH<sub>d-j-1</sub>(W) &rarr; Q/Z</em>.  I then explained that when <em>W</em> is connected and oriented with non-empty boundary, <em>&part;W</em> is a homology sphere if and only if both of these pairings are unimodular for <em>1 &leq; j &leq; d-1</em>.
	<br>We also discussed conditions for <em>&part;W</em> to be simply connected: when <em>W</em> is a handlebody it suffices that there are no 1-handles and no <em>(d-2)</em>-handles.  Finally, we discussed why a simply connected <em>(d-1)</em>-manifold whose homology is isomorphic to <em>H<sub>*</sub>(S<sup>d-1</sup>)</em> as a graded abelian group, is in fact homotopy equivalent to <em>S<sup>d-1</sup></em>.  I.e., a simply connected homology sphere is a homotopy sphere.  The proof used the Hurewicz theorem.

      <dd>Interpretation of intersection pairing and linking form in terms of cup product.  Intersection forms on a handlebody <em>W = D<sup>2n</sup> &cup; h<sup>n</sup> &cup; ... &cup; h<sup>n</sup></em> with <em>k</em> many <em>n</em>-handles can be represented by a matrix <em>A &in; M<sub>k</sub>(<b>Z</b>)</em>, which satisfies <em>A<sup>t</sup> = (-1)<sup>n</sup> A</em>, as a consequence of graded-commutativity of the cup product.
	
	<br>Review/reminder about cup products in relative cohomology and other versions of Poincare duality (see page 209 and Theorem 3.43 in <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Hatcher</a>, for example).  Support of a homology class (being supported in a subspace <em>K &sub; W</em> means being in the image of the homomorphism <em>H<sub>*</sub>(K) &rarr; H<sub>*</sub>(W)</em>) and of a cohomology class (being supported in a subspace <em>K &sub; W</em> means being in the image of the homomorphism <em>H<sup>*</sup>(W, W&setminus;K) &rarr; H<sup>*</sup>(W, &part;W)</em>).  For reasonably nice subspaces <em>K &sub; W\setminus;\part;W</em>, these notions of support are related via an isomorphism <em>H<sup>i</sup>(W, W&setminus;K) &rarr; H<sub>d-i</sub>(K)</em>, which in turn may be established from Poincare duality on some thickening of <em>K</em> to a compact codimension 0 submanifold of <em>W</em>.

	<br>Some consequences, in particular that the intersection product of two homology classes is zero if they are supported on disjoint sets.

      <dt>Sep 27</dt>
      <dd>External product <em>H<sup>n</sup>(X,X&setminus;K) x H<sup>m</sup>(Y,Y&setminus;L) &rarr; H<sup>n+m</sup>(XxY,XxY&setminus;KxL)</em> defined by pulling back along the projections and then taking cup (see page 214 in Hatcher for the case <em>K=L=&emptyset;</em>), used to define preferred generators <em>&sigma;<sub>d</sub> &in; H<sup>d</sup>(<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>,<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>,&setminus;{0})</em> as <em>d</em>-fold external product of some chosen <em>&sigma;<sub>1</sub></em>.  These generators will then satisfy the convenient compatibility that the external product <em>&sigma;<sub>n</sub> x &sigma;<sub>m</sub></em> is equal to <em>&sigma;<sub>n+m</sub></em>.

	<br>We take as official definition that an "orientation" of a compact <em>d</em>-manifold <em>M</em> means the specification of a homology class <em>[M]&in;H<sub>d</sub>(M,&part;M)</em> whose image in <em>H<sub>d</sub>(M,M&setminus;{x})</em> is a generator for each <em>x&in;M&setminus;&part;M</em>.  Given that, we can then say that a chart <em>&phi;:<b>R</b><sup>d</sup> &rarr; M</em> is "orientation preserving" if <em>(&phi;)<sub>*</sub>: H<sub>d</sub>(<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>,<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>&setminus;{0}) &rarr; H<sub>d</sub>(M,M&setminus;{&phi;(0)})</em> sends <em>&sigma;<sub>d</sub></em> to the image of <em>[M]</em>.  If a chart is <em>not</em> orientation preserving we say it is orientation-reversing.  For any orientation-reversing chart, we may obtain an orientation-preserving one with the same image by changing sign of one of the coordinates.

	<br>Then we explained how to evaluate the intersection pairing of a degree-<em>n</em> homology class with a degree-<em>m</em> homology class in an <em>(n+m)</em>-manifold as a sum of local contributions, in the case where the classes are supported on closed subsets <em>K</em> and <em>L</em> with <em>K&cap;L = {x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>r</sub>}</em> finite, and such that around each <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> there exists an orientation-preserving chart <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub></em> such that <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub><sup>-1</sup>(K) = <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>x{0}</em> and <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub><sup>-1</sup>(L) ={0}x<b>R</b><sup>m</sup></em> where <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> are the homological degrees of the homology classes.  Pulling back the corresponding cohomology classes along <em>&phi;<sub>i</sub></em> gives a class in <em>H<sup>m</sup>(<b>R</b><sup>m</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>m</sup>&setminus;{0})</em> and a class in <em>H<sup>n</sup>(<b>R</b><sup>n</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>&setminus;{0})</em> which can be written as <em>k<sub>i</sub>&sigma;<sub>m</sub></em> and <em>l<sub>i</sub>&sigma;<sub>n</sub></em> respectively, for some uniquely determined <em>k<sub>i</sub>, l<sub>i</sub> &in; <b>Z</b></em> for each <em>i&in;{1,...,r}</em>.  One must understand the homology classes well enough to work out these two integers (typically <em>&pm;1</em>) at each intersection point.  The outcome of our discussion was that then the intersection pairing of the classes is the dot product <em>&Sigma;<sub>i</sub> k<sub>i</sub>l<sub>i</sub></em>.
	
	<br>We also discussed self-intersection of <em>n</em>-dimensional homology classes <em>&alpha;</em> in a <em>2n</em>-dimensional manifold.  If such a class is supported on a compact subset <em>K</em> which can be pushed off of itself (meaning that the inclusion is homotopic to a map whose image is disjoint from <em>K</em>) then the intersection product of <em>&alpha;</em> with itself is automatically zero.  If not, the second-best think is to find a homotopy from the inclusion of <em>K</em> to a map with some image <em>L</em> intersecting <em>K</em> in a finite set such that there exist charts around each intersection point satisfying the condition we discussed when intersecting two distinct classes.  A good example to keep in mind for self-intersection is the disk bundle of an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector bundle over <em>S<sup>n</sup></em> with inner product, if the vector bundle splits off a trivial summand then the intersection matrix is <em>[0]&in;M<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>)</em>, but for the tangent bundle of <em>S<sup>n</sup></em> it is <em>[2]</em> when <em>n&geq;0</em> is even.

	<br>Finally, I stated the theorem that handlebodies of the form <em>W = D<sup>2n</sup> &cup; h<sup>n</sup> &cup;<sub>e_1</sub> ... &cup;<sub>e_r</sub> h<sup>n</sup></em> can have intersection matrix be any matrix of the form <em>B = A + (-1)<sup>n</sup>A<sup>t</sup></em> for some <em>A&in;M<sub>r</sub>(<b>Z</b>)</em> and explained the strategy of the construction/proof: first explain how to realize <em>A = 0</em>, then explain how to modify the embeddings <em>e_i</em> and <em>e_j</em> for <em>i &le; j</em> in a way that the <em>(i,j)</em> entry of <em>A</em> changes by <em>&pm; 1</em> and all other entries remain the same, and then explain how to modify <em>e_i</em> in a way the the <em>(i,i)</em>-entry changes by <em>&pm;1</em>.
	
	<br>At the end of the lecture I briefly indicated how to achieve the first of these steps, realizing the zero matrix as intersection matrix of a <em>2n</em>-dimensional handlbody.
